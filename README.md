# VRTKVerticalSlice
My first VR Vertical Slice, using VRTK and Oculus SDK. 

Majority of the assets I outsourced or obtained on the VRTK itself, but the mechanics (just the implementation), UI implemetation, audio addition and lighting was done by me.

If you have a working Oculus Rift station, be sure to check out if the game is working. I can't as I don't have one as of now.

Cheers!

Edit: Still don't have an Oculus Rift, however I do have some clips that I had recorded from a while back, check them out!
